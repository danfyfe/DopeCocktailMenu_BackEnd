eggnog = Cocktail.find_or_create_by(mood: cozy, name: "Eggnog", recipe: "In a large bowl, beat six egg yolks until they are lighter in color. Slowly add three fourths of a cup of sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. In a seperate pan, heat two cups of milk, two whole cloves, and a pinch of cinnamon, until the liquid starts to steam, but is not boiling. Add part of the hot milk mixture into the eggs, stirring constantly. Be careful not to add too much of the milk mixture into the eggs, or they will cook and ruin the nog. Pour the egg and milk mixture back into the pan and cook the eggnog on medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture begins to thicken and coats the back of the spoon. Be careful not to overcook the eggnog or it will curdle. Remove from heat and stir in one cup of heavy cream. Let the mixture chill.
