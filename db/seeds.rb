eggnog = Cocktail.find_or_create_by(mood: cozy, name: "Eggnog", recipe: "In a large bowl, beat 6 egg yolks until they are lighter in color. Slowly add 3/4 cup of sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. In a seperate pan, heat 2 cups of milk, 2 whole cloves, and a pinch of cinnamon, until the liquid starts to steam, but is not boiling. Add part of the hot milk mixture into the eggs, stirring constantly. Be careful not to add too much of the milk mixture into the eggs, or they will cook and ruin the nog. Pour the egg and milk mixture back into the pan and cook the eggnog on medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture begins to thicken and coats the back of the spoon. Be careful not to overcook the eggnog or it will curdle. Remove from heat and stir in 1 cup of heavy cream. Let the mixture chill. Strain the nog to get rid of any curdled pieces, add 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla, 1 teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg, 2 tablespoons of bourbon and 2 tablespoons of rum.
